The following requirements were needed for this project:

Challenge 08 - Bootstrap
For this challenge, you will have to make ​five fully responsive pages​ using
bootstrap. Refer to the ​screenshots & video ​folders to see the exact look of the
page.
- The ​navbar​ (active link) has a border on the left when you are on the
specified page. Also, clicking on the logo text goes back to the
homepage.
- The​ Homepage ​slider has modified indicators and the shadow of the
arrow is gone. Clicking on the play icon above “See What We Do”, opens
a modal with a video in it. After that, there is a gallery where you can
open every image in its full size in a modal by clicking on it.
Front End Academy - Challenge 08 - ​Bootstrap- On the ​About page​, the circled image has to be in the given position,
that is not a mistake. On this page also, above the footer, there is a
slider only with text, which doesn’t have indicators, only arrows.
- On the​ Services page​, the first banner above is not a slider. After that,
three panels are displaying information about the services provided.
And after them, some panels fold and are ​not an accordion​, which
means you can have as many of them as you want.
Front End Academy - Challenge 08 - ​Bootstrap- On the ​Blog page​, they are three posts, with images and content below
them.
-
Front End Academy - Challenge 08 - ​Bootstrap- The​ ​Contact page​ is straight forward, so there is not anything special
about it, except you will ​have​ to make it.
Responsive notes:
- The hamburger icon on the menu ​must ​work, but only from mobile
devices.
- The homepage slider text disappears on mobile devices.
- Use only 1 css file for every page.
Evaluation system:
1 point ​- Whole five page’s completed in HTML & CSS.
3 points ​- All of the above + responsive for tablet & mobile.
5 points ​- All of the above + ​make the gallery open every picture in a modal,
make the pop-up with the video, every paralax effect on the pictures, all the
hover effects and the rest functionalities shown in the video.
Deadline:
2 week after its presentation, 23:59h end of the day.
Note​:
- Bootstrap is a ​must​ for this challenge.
